## Implementation of Tic Tac Toe using TDD.

### Thoughts

Not having followed TDD before it felt like working out a muscle that I havent used. It was slow going and there was a lot of second guessing.

My goal was to write behaviour tests and keep away from smaller unit testing. This meant that I had to think about the implementation while writing the test, which was also difficult.
I used paper and pen to draw out some classes while I would write a test with the thought process _"For this test to work I would need X class with Y properties and Z methods"_.

This made it much easier to think about consequences of the test design. 

I dont know if this is _true_ TDD, but it did get me to think about my design consequences and gave me more confidence in my implementation as I had my diagram and had spent time thinking about the design.
